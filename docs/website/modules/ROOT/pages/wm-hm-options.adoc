= home-manager module options

Options found when wrapper-manager is included as part of home-manager module environment.
Here's a quickstart to enabling more features for wrapper-manager.

* wrapper-manager packages (e.g., `wrapper-manager.packages`) includes a special module argument `hmConfig` allowing you to set values conditionally.
For example, you could generate certain systemd units if under NixOS or home-manager but none if compiled as standalone package.

* You can add custom modules as part of the documentation with `wrapper-manager.documentation.extraModules`.
Pretty nifty feature but it requires you to make sure that all of the included modules are documented properly.

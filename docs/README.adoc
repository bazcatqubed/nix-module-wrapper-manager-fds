= Documentation
:toc:

This is where the documentation is created, namely both the website and the manual page.

* The website is powered by Antora and it is pretty much what makes most of the files here.
For remotely deploying it, we rely on Nix to be installed on the CI environment.

Furthermore, we have a link:./build-antora-site.nix[custom builder] for it.
Just take note of the limitation that it only works for local Git repos for now which is enough for our use cases.

* The manual page is powered by some under-documented tool in the Nix ecosystem (as is tradition) called https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/de19b7eaffd1ec24c50a6a257f3674a841ab1221/pkgs/tools/nix/nixos-render-docs/src/nixos_render_docs[nixos-render-docs].
The adjacent tools in the Nix-module-options-doc-generation ecosystem are also what makes the (autogenerated) Nix module options pages found in the website.

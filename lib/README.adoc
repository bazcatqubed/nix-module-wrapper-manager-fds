= wrapper-manager library set
:toc:

A custom library set for wrapper-manager.
It is basically a consolidated set of utilities and other goodies for various purposes such as additional string functions and systemd-related utilities for third-party module authors to extend upon the systemd module.

If you're interested in spelunking here, just take note that there is a convention for private files that start with an underscore ('_').
